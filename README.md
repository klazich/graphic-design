A collection of graphic design work I have done.

## The Loft Show

[The Louisville Loft Show](https://www.facebook.com/louloftshow/ "The Louisville Loft Show's Facebook Page")
Is a *monthly showcase of creativity*, put together by some really awesome people.

I was commissioned to create the posters for the September and October events.

### The Loft Show - September

I ended up creating two posters on the same design. A two-toned color print with
shading. And, a clean black and white print for cheaper and quicker copying.

### The Loft Show - October

I had to create this one on pretty short notice. I decided to try a
minimal black and white print.
